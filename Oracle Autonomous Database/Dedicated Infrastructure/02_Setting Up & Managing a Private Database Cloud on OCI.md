# Setting Up & Managing a Private Database Cloud on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

##  Overview

In Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), **Private Database Cloud** allows enterprises to run **Autonomous Databases** on **dedicated Exadata infrastructure**, giving complete control over infrastructure, configurations, and governance. This tutorial walks you through the setup, roles, responsibilities, and policy management in a Private Database Cloud environment.

---

##  Key Personas and Roles

| Role                             | OCI Group                     | Responsibilities                                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Fleet Administrator**          | `AcmeFA`                      | Manages Exadata infrastructure, AVM clusters, and ACDs. Governs budgets, SLAs, compliance. |
| **Database Administrator (DBA)** | `RoadrunnerDBA`, `CoyoteDBA`  | Creates and manages Autonomous Databases and Oracle DB users.                              |
| **Developer / DB User**          | N/A (No OCI Account Required) | Connects to Autonomous DB to develop apps and manage data.                                 |

##  1. Private Database Cloud Architecture Components

| Component                               | Description                                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exadata Infrastructure**              | Bare metal infrastructure (physical Exadata) provisioned in OCI. |
| **Autonomous VM Cluster (AVMC)**        | VM-based workload isolation on top of Exadata.                   |
| **Autonomous Container Database (ACD)** | A container that hosts multiple Autonomous Databases.            |
| **Autonomous Database (ADB)**           | Dedicated DBs for applications; self-service for DBAs.           |

---

##  2. Setup Workflow

###  Step 1: Fleet Admin – Set Up the Infrastructure

1. **Provision Exadata Infrastructure**
   Using OCI Console / CLI / SDK:

   * Region and AD selection
   * Shape selection (quarter rack, half rack, etc.)
   * Network and backup configuration

2. **Create Autonomous VM Cluster (AVM)**

   * Select Exadata Infra
   * Assign compartments
   * Configure CPU count, license type

3. **Create Autonomous Container Database (ACD)**

   * Specify compute & storage
   * Enable autoscaling and patching

4. **Allocate Compartments by Business Unit**

   * E.g., `FA`, `Roadrunner`, `Coyote`
   * Compartment = logical group for billing and access control

5. **Apply IAM Policies (next section)**

---

###  Step 2: IAM Policy Management

OCI uses **Policy Statements** to control access:

####  Common Verbs:

* `inspect`: minimal view-only (auditors)
* `read`: view all resource details
* `use`: use existing resources but not create/delete
* `manage`: full CRUD access

####  Sample Policies

#####  AcmeFA Group (Fleet Admins)

```text
Allow group AcmeFA to manage cloud-exadata-infrastructures in compartment FA
Allow group AcmeFA to manage autonomous-vm-clusters in compartment FA
Allow group AcmeFA to manage autonomous-container-databases in compartment FA
```

#####  RoadrunnerDBA / CoyoteDBA Groups (DBAs)

```text
Allow group RoadrunnerDBA to manage autonomous-databases in compartment Roadrunner
Allow group RoadrunnerDBA to manage autonomous-backups in compartment Roadrunner
Allow group RoadrunnerDBA to read autonomous-container-databases in compartment FA

Allow group CoyoteDBA to manage autonomous-databases in compartment Coyote
Allow group CoyoteDBA to manage autonomous-backups in compartment Coyote
Allow group CoyoteDBA to read autonomous-container-databases in compartment FA
```

 This allows DBAs to:

* Create ADBs in shared ACDs (created by Fleet Admins)
* Manage their own backups

---

###  Step 3: DBA – Create and Manage Autonomous Databases

1. **Create ADB in Shared ACD**

   * From OCI Console → Select ACD → Create Autonomous DB
   * Choose workload type: Transaction Processing, Data Warehouse, JSON, etc.
   * Set DB name, storage, CPUs

2. **Access Admin Credentials**

   * On creation, DBA receives the `ADMIN` user login
   * Can create new schemas/users inside ADB

3. **Backup and Restore**

   * Point-in-time recovery supported
   * Long-term backup retention available

4. **Scaling Options**

   * Manual CPU/storage scaling
   * Autoscaling if enabled

---

###  Step 4: Developers – Use the Database

* Developers **don’t need OCI accounts**
* DBA provides:

  * Wallet/connection credentials
  * DB name, service name
  * SQL Developer / JDBC / App connectivity instructions

##  Tooling & Operations

| Task         | Tooling Options                                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Provisioning | OCI Console / CLI / SDKs (Java, Python, Go, Node.js) |
| Monitoring   | OCI Monitoring, Alarms, Logging, Notifications       |
| Automation   | Terraform / Resource Manager                         |
| Updates      | Scheduled patching for Exadata infra, AVM, and ACD   |
| Events       | OCI Events + Notification Services for alerts        |

---

##  Advanced Governance Features

* **Compartments** for cost/budget alignment
* **Tags** for cost tracking
* **Quotas** to limit resource usage
* **Activity Auditing** with OCI Audit logs

##  Summary of Responsibilities

| Role                               | Provision Infra | Create ACD | Create ADB | Manage Backups | User Mgmt | Budget Control |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| Fleet Admin (`AcmeFA`)             | ✅               | ✅          | ❌          | ❌              | ❌         | ✅              |
| DBA (`RoadrunnerDBA`, `CoyoteDBA`) | ❌               | ❌          | ✅          | ✅              | ✅         | ❌              |
| Developer                          | ❌               | ❌          | ❌          | ❌              | ❌         | ❌              |

---

## Example Scenario

1. AcmeFA group provisions Exadata Infra, AVM, and ACD in the `FA` compartment.
2. CoyoteDBA group gets read access to ACD, and full manage rights in `Coyote` compartment.
3. A DBA from CoyoteDBA creates an Autonomous Database inside that ACD.
4. A developer receives credentials and builds an application that connects to this DB.
